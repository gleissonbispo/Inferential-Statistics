### <font color='red'> Verifying Hypothesis 1:  </font>
__1. Are salaries in the Brazilian South region higher than the Brazilian North region?__

We can affirm with 95% certainty based on that Data Base, the average of the **North Region** salary is contained in the confidence interval of the salaries of the **South Region**.
Therefore: **Reject H0**
