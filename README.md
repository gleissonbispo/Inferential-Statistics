# Inferential-Statistics

Inferential statistics use a random sample of data taken from a population to describe and make inferences about the population. Inferential statistics are valuable when examination of each member of an entire population is not convenient or possible. 
For example, to measure the diameter of each nail that is manufactured in a mill is impractical. 
You can measure the diameters of a representative random sample of nails. 
You can use the information from the sample to make generalizations about the diameters of all of the nails.
